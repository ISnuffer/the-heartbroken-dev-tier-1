						VSD Automation Senior Scientist November2022 - Present
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>As a Senior Scientist, I continue to oversee the lab I was coordinating as a scientist and maintain my team’s critical reagent tracking system as part of my regular job duties. I supervise work in-lab, help troubleshoot problems that impede workflow, and act as a hub of communication between lab operators, department management, PIs, and other personnel as necessary. While I do still operate a Hamilton and pull my weight in lab when throughput is on the heavier end, I don’t do so even daily anymore. I simply ensure that we have sufficient staffing and additional resources needed to complete the work requested, and if not work with department management to figure out how to set us up for success. This includes working in the freezer team to ensure we have well-organized storage space with sufficient room for sample return post-processing. While management decisions take precedent, I am included in higher-level discussions regarding lab events.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Much more of my time is spent designing and implementing process improvements as an extension of the work I did to both organize and automate the tracking of our critical reagent inventory. I’ve learned to become rather proficient with both VBA and SQL. Using these, I’ve designed several software tools that have significantly improved efficiency in the lab. Most recently with an updated method, my software is the only way to properly print the barcode needed for a particular step. Using these tools, I’ve continued to work towards a more efficient workflow for both my team and the department with approval from management where necessary.</p>

								Equipment and Software with which I've had experience in this position:  Tecan EVO and Hamilton STAR automated liquid handling platforms, Avidien Micropro, Artel MVS, ConneXion LIMS, eSheet documentation platform, ShelfLife documentation platform
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								I operate Tecan EVO and Hamilton STAR automated liquid handling platforms preparing human serum samples for chemical analysis in support of client-sponsored clinical trials. I document work activities using GCP and GLP standards per FDA regulatory standards. I perform troubleshooting and maintenance procedures for various automated instruments, including the Tecan EVO, Hamilton STAR, and Avidien Micropro.  I take a leadership role within the lab environment coordinating lab activities, training employees, suggesting process improvements to make production more efficient, and troubleshooting problems as they arise for myself and others within the day-to-day production environment. I oversee our control inventory for my sub-department, and designed the process by which we keep track of it. For this process, I lead a small team of assistant and associate scientists. I come to work with a generally positive attitude, and try to work by the philosophy that I want everyone I come in contact with to leave work feeling better about themselves than when they walked through the door.

								Equipment and Software with which I've had experience in this position:  pH meter, Fluoride meter, auto-titrator, manual and hydraulic presses, FTIR, Agilent GC with autoinjector, Agilent GC/MS, Instron rheometer, Tinius Olsen plastometer, Instron Extensometer, Microtrac particle size analyzers, and Smart Trac moisture analyzer with NMR
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Methods and Techniques with which I've had experience in this position:  Testing PTFE, FEP, and PFA for proportions of various structural groups via FTIR analysis, particle size both of powdered and dispersion product, pH, fluoride concentrations, extrusion pressure via rhemometer analysis, break strength via extensometer analysis, density and specific surface gravity, melt flow rate via plastometer analysis, surfactant concentrations both via GC and NMR analysis, testing for concentration of various compounds in a solution via titration (both manual and automated), GC/MS analysis for concentrations of toluene and methylene chloride, and GC analysis for concentrations of PFIB in gas samples.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								My experience includes working in the Quality Control laboratory of a major polymer manufacturing facility.  I was hired into a very short-staffed laboratory setting and had to quickly pick up on the skill-set required in the lab to keep up with clients’ demands.  I have learned how to operate and maintain the instruments and otherwise operate a laboratory performing testing required for the production of fluorinated polymer compounds.  This includes knowledge of troubleshooting the equipment.  I also learned a lot about the polymer production process, and how to safely work around and with hazardous chemicals and equipment. I was qualified in every method group in the lab, while my job title required me to only be qualified in three of the four. Towards the end of my time here, I took an unofficial leadership capacity within the lab training new employees as my shift team lost half our staff and troubleshooting problems that arose within the lab environment for both myself and others.

								Methods and Techniques with which I've had experience in this position:  EPA methods 2540 (solids analysis), 405.1 (BOD5), 200.7 and 200.8 (metals analysis of water), 6010 and 6020 (metals analysis of solid samples), and 1311 (TCLP analysis of solid waste samples), and natural and mine gas analysis via GC.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								My experience here included learning a variety of EPA analysis methods for water testing and other forms of environmental analysis needed by company clients.  I was hired as the company was beginning to rapidly grow their customer base and had to learn quickly and work hard in order to keep up with the growing demand in an understaffed laboratory.  Along with other analysts and company management, I was involved in the process of figuring out how to most efficiently organize our work environment to increase production while decreasing the occurrence of problems and human error.  As more analysts were hired and staffing became less of a concern; I was given the opportunity to run more methods, learn more about the industry and how the company fit into the grand scheme of things, and learn to use a variety of laboratory instrumentation including GC, ICP-OES, and ICP-MS.

The project involved using a variety of chromatography techniques, including HPLC, to isolate the cytotoxic compounds believed to be in the plant based on previous research by Crick.  This project gave me my first lab experience outside of organized classwork, a working knowledge of how to use chromatography, a taste of laboratory instrumentation, and a glimpse of the scientific community.
